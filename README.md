### Overview

In our web development course, we made a pacman simple game. HTML, CSS, JQuery, and Javascript were all used.
The game is built according to the instructions provided by the course staff. To make the game look better, we
also add our own design and images.

## What can you find on our site

- **Home** - a page that contains a logo, pacman gif, Register and Login buttons.
- **Register** - the registration page uses jquery validation to ensure that the inputs are valid.
- **Login** - the login page uses jquery validation to ensure that the inputs are valid.
- **Settings** - the user is asked to select preferences for the game, such as the number of food balls, the number of ghosts, the time of the game, and the colors of   the food points. The user can change preferences at random by clicking a button.
- **Game** - the pacman game contains a board, details screen that explains the game's features, and setting screen that allows you to change the game's settings.

## Game Rules:

- Move around the board using the keys selected.
- Eat food for points. There are three types of food points: small worth 5 points, medium worth 15 points, and large worth 25 points.
- You lose 1 life and 10 points if a ghost catches the pacman.
- You get 50 points if you eat the moving money bag.
- The game ends when:
  - Win: The time is up and the score is above 100 points.
  - Lose: if Pacman loses all its lives (Loser) or if the time runs out and the score is below 100 points (You can do better...)
